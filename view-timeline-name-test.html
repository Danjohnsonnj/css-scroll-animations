          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This specification defines mechanisms for driving the progress of an
            animation based on the scroll progress of a scroll container. These
            scroll-driven animations use a timeline based on scroll position,
            rather than one based on clock time. This module provides both an
            imperative API building on the Web Animations API as well as a
            declarative API building on CSS Animations. [WEB-ANIMATIONS-1]
          </p>

          <p>There are two types of scroll-driven timelines:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Scroll Progress Timelines, which are linked to the scroll progress
              of a particular scroll container
            </li>

            <li>
              View Progress Timelines, which are linked to the view progress of
              a particular box through a scrollport
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Scroll Progress Timelines</h2>
          <p>
            Scroll progress timelines are timelines linked to progress in the
            scroll position of a scroll container along a particular axis. The
            startmost scroll position represents 0% progress and the endmost
            scroll position represents 100% progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scroll progress timelines can be referenced in animation-timeline
            anonymously using the scroll() functional notation or by name (see
            §4.2 Named Timeline Scoping and Lookup) after declaring them using
            the scroll-timeline properties. In the Web Animations API, they can
            be represented anonymously by a ScrollTimeline object.
          </p>

          <h2>3. View Progress Timelines</h2>
          <p>
            Often animations are desired to start and end during the portion of
            the scroll progress timeline that a particular box (the view
            progress subject) is in view within the scrollport. View progress
            timelines are segments of a scroll progress timeline that are scoped
            to the scroll positions in which any part of the subject element’s
            principal box intersects its nearest ancestor scrollport (or more
            precisely, the relevant view progress visibility range of that
            scrollport). The startmost such scroll position represents 0%
            progress, and the endmost such scroll position represents 100%
            progress; see §3.2 Calculating Progress for a View Progress
            Timeline.
          </p>

          <p>
            NOTE: The 0% and 100% scroll positions are not always reachable,
            e.g. if the box is positioned at the start edge of the scrollable
            overflow rectangle, it might not be possible to scroll to < 32%
            progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            View progress timelines can be referenced anonymously using the
            view() functional notation or by name (see § 4.2 Named Timeline
            Scoping and Lookup) after declaring them using the view-timeline
            properties on the view progress subject. In the Web Animations API,
            they can be represented anonymously by a ViewTimeline object.
